# Daweijita Downloader

So my uncle recently bought a guitar and has been getting tabs off of [this site](http://daweijita.com). He wants to print the tabs so he can refer to them without loading the site, but unfortunately the site has disabled right clicking 😱

I threw together this userscript during the morning coffee break to add a button to open all the sheets in new tabs. Not sure if it still works or if 大伟吉他 has added further obfuscation to hide content, so use at your own risk.

## Installation
[Install the user.js here](https://github.com/bxio/daweijita/raw/master/daweijita.user.js)

If you're on Firefox you'll probably need [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).
